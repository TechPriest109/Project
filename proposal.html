        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
             [For our project we want to create a photographer booking web app for a photographer friend of ours. Current photographer booking services such as 
            <a href="https://www.flytographer.com" target="_blank">Flytographer</a> help people find photographers but at a very steep price. A personal more localized web app will provide
            less competition, and more opportunity to get his name and reputation out there, as well as allow for more competitive pricing.]

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            [Describe the web app you will create to address the chosen problem. Explain who the users are, what kind of information they will view, and how they will interact with the app. Discuss how using this app will help solve the identified problem.]
