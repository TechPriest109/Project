                <h2>Problem Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        [For our project we want to create a photographer booking web app for a photographer friend of ours. Current photographer booking services such as 
                        <a href="https://www.flytographer.com" target="_blank">Flytographer</a> help people find photographers but at a very steep price. A personal more localized web app will provide
                        less competition, and more opportunity to get his name and reputation out there, as well as allow for more competitive pricing.]

                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
                <p>
                    [Describe the web app you will create to address the chosen problem. 
                    Explain who the users are, what kind of information they will view, 
                    and how they will interact with the app. Discuss how using this app will 
                    help solve the identified problem.]
                    The web app that we will be developing is a services based business app. 
                    In which a client will be able to fill in a form, requesting whatever services they require, 
                    on whichever date they require these services. The form ideally includes a interactive
                    calendar linked to a calendar to check if a scheduling conflict exists then 
                    if said conflict exists these dates would be blocked off.
                    After completing the form and selecting the services package, the data from the form then 
                    renders into an invoice for the business. 
                    Bonus Idea: Having the location of where the services are being rendered, included in the work
                    order, if for arguements sake a photo shoot was booked in Pensacola on 1/30/2024,
                    and a different client was booking a photo shoot in Seattle on 1/31/2024 the app would 
                    automatically pad that date out to 2/1/2024 adding the extra day as a travel day for 
                    the freelancer added to the invoice
                </p>
